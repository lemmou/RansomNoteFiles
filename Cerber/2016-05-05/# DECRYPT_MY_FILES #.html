         <p>Cannot you find the files you need?<br>Is the content of the files that you looked for not readable?</p>
         <p>It is normal because the files' names, as well as the data in your files have been encrypted.</p>
         <p>Great!!!<br>You have turned to be a part of a big community #CerberRansomware.</p>
         <hr>

         <hr>
         <h3>What is encryption?</h3>
         <p>Encryption is a reversible modification of information for security reasons but providing full access to it for authorized users.</p>
         <p>To become an authorized user and keep the modification absolutely reversible (in other words to have a possibility to decrypt your files) you should have an individual private key.</p>
         <p>But not only it.</p>
         <p>It is required also to have the special decryption software (in your case "Cerber Decryptor" software) for safe and complete decryption of all your files and data.</p>
         <hr>
         <h3>Everything is clear for me but what should I do?</h3>
         <p>The first step is reading these instructions to the end.</p>
         <p>Your files have been encrypted with the "Cerber Ransomware" software; the instructions ("# DECRYPT MY FILES #.html" and "# DECRYPT MY FILES #.txt") in the folders with your encrypted files are not viruses, they will help you.</p>
         <p>After reading this text the most part of people start searching in the Internet the words the "Cerber Ransomware" where they find a lot of ideas, recommendations and instructions.</p>
         <p>It is necessary to realize that we are the ones who closed the lock on your files and we are the only ones who have this secret key to open them.</p>
         <p><span class="warning">Any attempts to get back your files with the third-party tools can be fatal for your encrypted files.</span></p>
         <p>The most part of the third-party software change data within the encrypted file to restore it but this causes damage to the files.</p>
         <p>Finally it will be impossible to decrypt your files.</p>
         <p>When you make a puzzle but some items are lost, broken or not put in its place - the puzzle items will never match, the same way the third-party software will ruin your files completely and irreversibly.</p>
         <p>You should realize that any intervention of the third-party software to restore files encrypted with the "Cerber Ransomware" software may be fatal for your files.</p>
         <hr>
         <p><span class="warning">There are several plain steps to restore your files but if you do not follow them we will not be able to help you, and we will not try since you have read this warning already.</span></p>
         <hr>

         <h3>What should you do with these addresses?</h3>
         <p>If you read the instructions in TXT format (if you have instruction in HTML (the file with an icon of your Internet browser) then the easiest way is to run it):</p>
         <ol>
         <li>take a look at the first address (in this case it is <a href="http://decrypttozxybarc.dconnect.eu/[removed]" target="_blank">http://decrypttozxybarc.dconnect.eu/[removed]</a>);</li>
         <li>select it with the mouse cursor holding the left mouse button and moving the cursor to the right;</li>
         <li>release the left mouse button and press the right one;</li>
         <li>select "Copy" in the appeared menu;</li>
         <li>run your Internet browser (if you do not know what it is run the Internet Explorer);</li>
         <li>move the mouse cursor to the address bar of the browser (this is the place where the site address is written);</li>
         <li>click the right mouse button in the field where the site address is written;</li>
         <li>select the button "Insert" in the appeared menu;</li>
         <li>then you will see the address <a href="http://decrypttozxybarc.dconnect.eu/[removed]" target="_blank">http://decrypttozxybarc.dconnect.eu/[removed]</a> appeared there;</li>
         <li>press ENTER;</li>
         <li>the site should be loaded; if it is not loaded repeat the same instructions with the second address and continue until the last address if falling.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>If for some reason the site cannot be opened check the connection to the Internet; if the site still cannot be opened take a look at the instructions on omitting the point about working with the addresses in the HTML instructions.</p>
         <p>If you browse the instructions in HTML format:</p>
         <ol>
         <li>click the left mouse button on the first address (in this case it is <a href="http://decrypttozxybarc.dconnect.eu/[removed]" target="_blank">http://decrypttozxybarc.dconnect.eu/[removed]</a>);</li>
         <li>in a new tab or window of your web browser the site should be loaded; if it is not loaded repeat the same instructions with the second address and continue until the last address.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>If for some reason the site cannot be opened check the connection to the Internet.</p>
         <hr>
         <p>Unfortunately these sites are short-term since the antivirus companies are interested in you do not have a chance to restore your files but continue to buy their products.</p>
         <p>Unlike them we are ready to help you always.</p>
         <p>If you need our help but the temporary sites are not available:</p>
         <ol>
         <li>run your Internet browser (if you do not know what it is run the Internet Explorer);</li>
         <li>enter or copy the address <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en" target="_blank">https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en</a> into the address bar of your browser and press ENTER;</li>
         <li>wait for the site loading;</li>
         <li>on the site you will be offered to download Tor Browser; download and run it, follow the installation instructions, wait until the installation is completed;</li>
         <li>run Tor Browser;</li>
         <li>connect with the button "Connect" (if you use the English version);</li>
         <li>a normal Internet browser window will be opened after the initialization;</li>
         <li>type or copy the address <span class="tor">http://decrypttozxybarc.onion/[removed]</span> in this browser address bar;</li>
         <li>press ENTER;</li>
		 <li>the site should be loaded; if for some reason the site is not loading wait for a moment and try again.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>If you have any problems during installation or operation of Tor Browser, please, visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=install+tor+browser+windows" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/</a> and type request in the search bar "install tor browser windows" and you will find a lot of training videos about Tor Browser installation and operation.</p>
         <p>If TOR address is not available for a long period (2-3 days) it means you are late; usually you have about 2-3 weeks after reading the instructions to restore your files.</p>
         <hr>
         <h3>Additional information:</h3>
         <p>You will find the instructions for restoring your files in those folders where you have your encrypted files only.</p>
         <p>The instructions are made in two file formats - HTML and TXT for your convenience.</p>

         <p>The instructions are not viruses; they have informative nature only, so any claims on the absence of any instruction files you can send to your antivirus company.</p>
